# Processing data of concentration of SARS-CoV-2 samples in sputum, and saliva samples
# taken from the uper respiratory track (urt). 

# Data obtained from: 
    #"Viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples" (Pan, 2020) 
    #"Virological assessment of hospitalized cases of coronavirus disease 2019" (WÃ¶lfel,2020); Figure 2_ Data
    #"Viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in first two patients in Korea" (Kim, 2020)
    #"Temporal profiles of viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study" (To, 2020)


# Assumptions: Since concentrations on sputum, uper respiratiry track (urt), and saliva were similar, we used 
             # from sputum, urt and saliva in the concentration dataset.
             # From the study @To2020, initial and peak concentrations were both used
