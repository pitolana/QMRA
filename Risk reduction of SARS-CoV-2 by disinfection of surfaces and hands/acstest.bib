@book{Haas2014,
abstract = {Provides the latest QMRA methodologies to determine infection risk cause by either accidental microbial infections or deliberate infections caused by terrorism. Reviews the latest methodologies to quantify at every step of the microbial exposure pathways, from the first release of a pathogen to the actual human infection. Provides techniques on how to gather information, on how each microorganism moves through the environment, how to determine their survival rates on various media, and how people are exposed to the microorganism. Explains how QMRA can be used as a tool to measure the impact of interventions and identify the best policies and practices to protect public health and safety. Includes new information on genetic methods. Techniques use to develop risk models for drinking water, groundwater, recreational water, food and pathogens in the indoor environment.},
